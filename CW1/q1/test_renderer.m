function [] = test_renderer(renderer)
% test_renderer checks that a renderer is functionally correct,
% by checking it against the reference render_julia function
% for various (w,h,c,maxiter) test?points.
% The set of test?points chosen is up to the implementation,
% and should be chosen to balance likelihood of error?detection
% against execution time.
% The function should fail using assert if any test fails, or
% run to completion otherwise.
